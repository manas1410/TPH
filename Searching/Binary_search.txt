step-1-Compare x with the middle element.
step-2-If x matches with middle element, we return the mid index.
step-3-Else If x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in right half subarray after the mid element. So we recur for right half.
step-4-Else (x is smaller) recur for the left half.
