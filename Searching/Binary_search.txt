## Algorithm
Step-1:Compare x with the middle element.
Step-2:If x matches with middle element, we return the mid index.
Step-3:Else If x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in right half subarray after the mid element. So we recur for right half.
Step-4:Else (x is smaller) recur for the left half.
